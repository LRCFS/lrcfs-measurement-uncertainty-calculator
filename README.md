# Measurement Uncertainty Calculator

The Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science Measurement Uncertainty Calculator (MUCalc) is an application for calculating measurement uncertainty in accordance with the standards of International Organization for Standardization ISO/IEC 17025.

The software computes uncertainty components for Method Precision, Standard Solution, Sample Volume and Calibration Curve with the Calibration Curve assumed to be linear. If data is uploaded for all four components, the Combined Uncertainty is computed using all four components. An uncertainty component can be excluded from the Combined Uncertainty by simply not uploading any data for that component.

Once data is uploaded, a step by step computation and details of all formulas used can be accessed for reviewed.
