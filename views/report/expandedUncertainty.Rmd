## Expanded Uncertainty

### Overview

The expanded uncertainty  is the final step of measurement uncertainty computation. This is done in order to derive a confidence interval believed to contain the true unknown value.

It is computed by multiplying the Combined Uncertainty \((\text{CombUncertainty})\) with the coverage factor \((k_{{\large\nu}_{\text{eff}}, {\small CL\%}})\).

### Method

The expanded uncertainty \(\text{(ExpUncertainty)}\) is given by:

$\text{ExpUncertainty} = k_{{\large\nu}_{\text{eff}}, {\small CL\%}} \times \text{CombUncertainty}$

with percentage expanded uncertainty given by:

$\text{%ExpUncertainty} = \frac{\text{ExpUncertainty}}{x_s} \times 100$

where:

- \(k_{{\large\nu}_{\text{eff}}, {\small CL\%}}\) is the coverage factor based on effective degrees of freedom and specified confidence interval percentage.

- \({\small\text{CombUncertainty}}\) is the combined uncertainty.

- \(x_s\) case sample mean concentration.
